# ESP32 Jet ECU Wiki Documentation

This is an older version of the project. A newer version is available in my repositories under the name **JetEcu**.

https://github.com/elia179/JetEcu


This firmware is designed for an ESP32-based engine control unit (ECU) that manages engine startup, ignition, oil pressure regulation, throttle control, and various safety systems. The ECU reads multiple sensor inputs, performs dynamic idle adjustments, and communicates over both a secondary serial channel (for an instrument cluster) and via Bluetooth. This document explains the hardware setup, software structure, and detailed function-by-function reference.

## Overview

The ESP32 Jet ECU firmware implements an engine control system with multiple functions including:
- **Startup and Ignition Sequence:** Gradual starter control, oil feed adjustments, and flame detection.
- **Dynamic Idle Control:** Adaptive throttle management based on idle input, current RPM, and target idle RPM.
- **Sensor Monitoring:** Continuous acquisition of temperature (via a MAX6675 thermocouple module), RPM (using the ESP32’s PCNT peripheral), oil pressure (via ADC readings), and flame detection.

## Software Architecture

### Global Configuration & Flags

The firmware uses a number of defined constants and global flags to control behavior:

- **RPM Limits & Temperature Thresholds:**  
  - `MIN_RPM`, `TGT_RPM`, and `RPM_LIMIT` are used to ensure the engine is operating within safe speeds.
  - `TOT_THRESHOLD` defines the maximum allowable temperature.
  
- **Timing Variables:**  
  - `READ_INTERVAL` governs how often sensor data is refreshed.
  - Delay values and iteration counts are embedded in routines like `sleep()` and oil pressure adjustments.
  
- **Mode Flags:**  
  - Flags such as `skipSafetyChecks`, `dynamicIdleEnabled`, `enableSensorData`, and `disableStarterWhenRunning` let users override or toggle key safety and performance features during testing or operation.

### Main Control Flow

- **`setup()` Function:**  
  Performs initialization of serial communications, pin modes, ADC calibration, PCNT (pulse counter) configuration, EEPROM retrieval, watchdog setup, and attachment of ESC servo objects. It then sets the device to a safe idle state while performing an idle calibration.

- **`loop()` Function:**  
  The core loop toggles the status LED and continually updates sensor data (via `readAndReportTemperature()`), monitors safety conditions, and processes user input (when not running). When the engine is active (`runningState` is true), it executes throttle and oil feed management and monitors for overspeed/low RPM conditions.

## Detailed Function Reference

### Setup and Loop

- **`setup()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Configures all hardware interfaces (GPIO, serial, ADC, PCNT, EEPROM, servos) and initializes the system.
  - **Actions:**
    - Starts Bluetooth and secondary serial communications.
    - Configures pin modes and initial states.
    - Loads throttle calibration values from EEPROM.
    - Initializes ADC channels and pulse counter for RPM.
    - Sets initial safe states for oil pump, throttle, and starter.
  
- **`loop()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Main execution loop; updates sensor data, maintains watchdog resets, processes engine running conditions, and listens for commands when idle.
  - **Behavior:**  
    - Toggles LED as a heartbeat indicator.
    - Updates temperature and RPM every `READ_INTERVAL` milliseconds.
    - Checks for safety conditions (low/high RPM, over-temperature) and invokes shutdown if needed.
    - If the engine is off (`!runningState`), monitors switches and listens for Bluetooth commands.

### Engine Start-up Sequence

- **`startup()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Implements the engine starting sequence.
  - **Steps:**
    - Notifies via serial channels and enables the starter ESC.
    - Reads idle throttle value from ADC and calculates a starting throttle position.
    - Adjusts oil pressure using `setOilValue()` and gradually ramps up the starter ESC.
    - Activates the igniter once RPM thresholds are met; monitors for successful flame detection.
    - On successful ignition, the engine enters running state and dynamic idle control is enabled.
  
### Engine Shutdown and Cooldown

- **`shutdown()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Safely stops engine operation and reboots the ESP32.
  - **Behavior:**
    - Disables the watchdog timer.
    - Sets throttle, starter ESC, and oil pump to safe positions.
    - Initiates a cooldown sequence—if running—by maintaining oil feed until RPM falls below threshold.
    - Uses a final starter activation to cool the turbine before restarting the ESP32.

### Sensor Readings & Data Processing

- **`readAndReportTemperature()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Reads the engine temperature using the MAX6675 thermocouple.
  - **Actions:**  
    - Validates temperature readings and updates the TOT (Temperature Over Time) variable.
    - Calls `calculateRPM()` to compute and average engine RPM.
    - Transmits temperature and RPM data to both the instrument cluster and Bluetooth.
    - Invokes oil pressure adjustments and checks for over-temperature shutdown conditions.

- **`flameDetector()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Determines if ignition or flame is present.
  - **Mechanism:**  
    - Reads the flame sensor via ADC and compares the average to a predefined threshold.

- **`readPressure()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Reads an analog value from the oil pressure sensor and converts it into a pressure (in bars) using a quadratic approximation.

### System Control Functions

- **`setOilRpm(int oilPercentage)`**  
  - **Purpose:** Generates a PWM signal on the oil pump output pin.
  - **Implementation:**  
    - Maps a given percentage value to a PWM duty cycle and updates the oil pump accordingly.

- **`setOilValue(float oilPressureTarget, bool singleAdjustment)`**  
  - **Purpose:** Dynamically adjusts the oil pump’s output to reach a desired oil pressure.
  - **Logic:**  
    - Continuously reads oil pressure, computes the difference to the target, and adjusts the pump speed incrementally.
    - Performs a fixed number of iterations before terminating if the target isn’t reached.

- **`setStarterESC(int targetSetting, float accelerationFactor)`**  
  - **Purpose:** Controls the starter ESC servo by gradually transitioning from the current setting to the target.
  - **Details:**  
    - Uses a step delay (computed from an acceleration factor) to provide a smooth change.
    - Monitors sensor data during the transition and checks for a stop condition.

- **`updateThrottleESC(int requestedValue)`**  
  - **Purpose:** Generates throttle control signals based on either automatic sensor inputs or a direct value.
  - **Features:**
    - When in automatic mode (requestedValue is 1), it reads throttle and idle potentiometers.
    - Implements dynamic idle adjustment using a rolling average of RPM and timing of idle events.
    - Contains safeguards to lower throttle output if RPM or temperature exceed safe limits.
    - Allows manual override when requested.

### Communication & Command Handling

  - **`getAverageADC(int pin, int samples)`**  
    - Performs multiple ADC readings on a given pin and returns their average. This is used to smooth sensor data.

### Calibration & Averaging Utilities

- **`calibrateMinThrottle()`**  
  - **Purpose:** Calibrates the minimum throttle position during startup using multiple ADC samples from the throttle potentiometer.
  - **Outcome:**  
    - Adjusts the global `minThrottleValue` if enough valid samples are obtained; otherwise, forces a reboot (if configured).
